# Employee Retention Project – Salifort Corporation

This project addresses the high employee turnover rate observed at **Salifort Corporation**. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the goal is to uncover the key factors behind employee attrition and provide data-driven recommendations to improve employee retention.


## 📌 Project Overview
Salifort Corporation has experienced an increased employee turnover rate. This project aims to:
- Identify the primary factors contributing to attrition.
- Predict which employees are likely to leave using ML models.
- Offer actionable recommendations for employee retention strategies.

## 🧠 The project follows a full data science pipeline:
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building (Classification)
5. Model evaluation & selection
6. Insights and recommendations
